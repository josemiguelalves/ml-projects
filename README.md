# Machine Learning Projects
Repository containing small machine learning projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Analysis of Non-linearities in Deep Networks](https://github.com/josemiguelalves/ml-projects/tree/main/activations-functions): Empirical evaluation of activation functions to understand if the usage of ReLU still remains justified. This work examines the performance of a state-of-the-art model, with varied activation functions, against MNIST - a bench-mark dataset. The results have found that the ELU activation function has a better speed of convergence and exceeds the performance of the ReLU function.
	- [On-line novelty detection framework](https://github.com/josemiguelalves/ml-projects/tree/main/novelty-detection): This work proposes an online novelty detection framework that addresses the issues of identifying a pattern change in online data streams. In this implementation, only ”normal” data is available for offline training. The framework uses supervised and unsupervised learning to train an autoencoder model that can adapt to changes in the data distribution.
